Module 4 Challenge

The data contained in the PyCitySchools notebook outlines the performance of a group of schools. Some are district schools and some are charter schools. They all vary in size and spending budgets.

From the data contained within, I was able to draw these two conclusions:
    1. More money per student DOES NOT equate to better scores
    2. Smaller school sizes DOES equate to better test scores
